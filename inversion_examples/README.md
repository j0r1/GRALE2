Lens inversion examples
-----------------------

These examples are based on the ones for the [original](http://research.edm.uhasselt.be/jori/page/Physics/GraleV1.html)
version of Grale/Graleshell. The way the Python scripts are built
is fairly straightforward. Of course, because of the use of Python now,
things can be automated in many more interesting ways than is done
in these scripts, but for the purpose of illustrating the main commands
it is probably not a bad idea to keep things simple.
