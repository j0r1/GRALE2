Things that are in graleshell and may be useful to provide:
 - lens/new/scaledegen: construct generalized mass scale/mass sheet degeneracy
   as described in 2008 article, based on a lens and images
 - lens/new/timedelay: modify lens so that timedelay at certain position is
   modified, without affecting other properties
 - lens/new/magadjust: adjust magnification at specific point
 - imgdata/backproj/all: project imgdata to source plane
 - imgdata/fitness: calculate fitness according to inversion module
 - imgdata/nds: calculate non-dominated set

Merge grids, use multiple grids for inversion
